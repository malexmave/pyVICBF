"""This module implements a Variable-Increment Counting Bloom Filter.

The VI-CBF was originally proposed by Rottenstreich et al. in their paper
"The Variable-Increment Counting Bloom Filter", IEEE INFOCOM 2012,

    http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ykanizo/papers/tr11-05_variable.pdf

The VI-CBF is an improvement over the regular CBF, as it provides a lower
False Positive Rate with the same number of bits. It works by incrementing
the counters of the bloom filter with variable values when inserting
elements, as opposed to simply incrementing by one. This allows more
accurate statements about the likelyhood that a certain element is in
a certain filter.

For more details, check the original paper (linked above).

This implementation is built for readability, not efficiency. If you need an
efficient VICBF implementation, build your own :)
